					<h2><strong>Meaningful</strong> sentiments.</h2>
					<p>
						These elaborate event write ups are just a way of me saying,<br/>

					<p>
						So I hope you guys can make it out. It'd be pretty cool if you did.

					<p>
						I look forward to the countless life talks, meaningless banter, and everything inbetween.
